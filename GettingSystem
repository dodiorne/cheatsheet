#There are several ways to gain SYSTEM-level access on a host, including but not limited to:

    Remote Windows exploits such as EternalBlue or BlueKeep.
    Abusing a service running in the context of the SYSTEM account.
    |Abusing SeImpersonate privileges using [RottenPotatoNG](https://github.com/breenmachine/RottenPotatoNG) against older Windows systems|
    Juicy Potato (https://github.com/ohpe/juicy-potato), or PrintSpoofer (https://github.com/itm4n/PrintSpoofer) if targeting Windows 10/Windows Server 2019 (https://itm4n.github.io/printspoofer-abusing-impersonate-privileges/).
    Local privilege escalation flaws in Windows operating systems such as the Windows 10 Task Scheduler 0day.
    PsExec with the -s flag

#By gaining SYSTEM-level access on a domain-joined host, we will be able to:

 
    Enumerate the domain and gather data such as information about domain users and groups, local administrator access, domain trusts, ACLs, user and computer properties, etc., using BloodHound, and PowerView/SharpView.
    Perform Kerberoasting / ASREPRoasting attacks.
    Run tools such as Inveigh (https://github.com/Kevin-Robertson/Inveigh) to gather Net-NTLM-v2 hashes or perform relay attacks.
    Perform token impersonation to hijack a privileged domain user account.
    Carry out ACL attacks.
